## Publications

Please cite the following two papers if you are using our tool. Thanks!

## Required Inputs

1. **Tokenized Raw Texts**
  - Example: ```data/BC5CDR/raw_text.txt```
    - One token per line.
    - An empty line means the end of a sentence.
2. **Two Dictionaries**
  - **Core Dictionary w/ Type Info**
    - Example: ```data/BC5CDR/dict_core.txt```
      - Two columns (i.e., Type, Tokenized Surface) per line.
      - Tab separated.
    - How to obtain?
      - From domain-specific dictionaries.
      
  - **Full Dictionary w/o Type Info**
    - Example: ```data/BC5CDR/dict_full.txt```
      - One tokenized high-quality phrases per line.
    - How to obtain? 
      - From domain-specific dictionaries.
      - Applying the high-quality phrase mining tool on domain-specific corpus.
        - [AutoPhrase](https://github.com/shangjingbo1226/AutoPhrase) 
3. **Pre-trained word embeddings**
  - Train your own or download from the web.
4. **[Optional]** Development & Test Sets.
  - Example: ```data/BC5CDR/truth_dev.ck``` and ```data/BC5CDR/truth_test.ck```
    - Three columns (i.e., token, ```Tie or Break``` label, entity type).
    - ```I``` is ```Berak```.
    - ```O``` is ```Tie```.
    - Two special tokens ```<s>``` and ```<eof>``` mean the start and end of the sentence.

## Dependencies

TODO(shangjingbo): conda install with specific pytorch version.

## Run

To train an AutoNER model, please run
```
./autoner_train.sh
```

To apply the trained AutoNER model, please run
```
./autoner_test.sh
```

You can specify the parameters in the bash files. The variables names are self-explained.
